tagline: "Introduce a curated array of naughtiness to your chats."

creator_notes: "
This simple stage allows you to inject all manner of fetishes into your chats. It selects a set of fetishes, 
a random mechanism by which those fetishes are introduced to the scenario (e.g., government mandate or char's fondest dreams), 
and the extremity of promotion. It's all random by default, but you can override these settings from the configuration window.

I've marked this one NSFL; there is a broad spectrum of junk in here and I didn't want to have to handle with care. 
It's all configurable and you know what you can handle, so please be smart about it.

# 'ADJACENT' is default. The frame will display on the side of the

# 'NONE' will not display, only run.
# 'COVER' will, indeed, cover the chat history completely,
#   but leave the text input box.
# 'FULLSCREEN' will make nothing below the header bar
#   show except for your stage.
position: 'NONE'
